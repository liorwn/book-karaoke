I was sitting across from a CEO last year — let's call him David — in a glass-walled conference room overlooking downtown Austin. His company does about forty million a year. Impressive team. Good culture. Growing.

I asked him a simple question: "Walk me through what happens when a new customer signs up."

He smiled. "Oh, that's easy. Sales closes the deal, hands it to onboarding, onboarding gets them set up, and then customer success takes over."

"Great," I said. "Now walk me through what actually happens."

David paused. Thought about it. Then started talking. Slowly at first, then faster, like a thread unraveling.
